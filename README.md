## Description

I built a web app to keep recored of two persons playing a game

## Process
The game has three buttons, Player one, Player two and the reset button
First the gamers has to set the number they're player to, that starts the game afresh
Then there point is recorder as the players click their respective buttons
When the length the players set has been reached, the button are dissabled and the points indicates the winner
The winner gets a green light on his point while the looser get a red light on his points
Finally, when the reset button is clicked, the game starts over a again
